When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
That would make it easier for me to work on my project any place I want, on any type of computer,
  as long as I have Internet connectiong to access remote
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If I let Git do that automatically, there will probable too many commits where I haven't finished doing my logical change

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork: clone a repository from another person's github to my github
  Used when I want to make logically change on others' code
Clone: make a copy of a repository remotely from a github page, or locally on my computer
  Used when I want to work on my code, which is available on Github, on my computer
Branch: make a new branch on the current repository
  Used when I want to make changes/ add more features to my code without affecting the main/working one
