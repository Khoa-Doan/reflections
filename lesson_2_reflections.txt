What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates a .git file that manage my commits

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
    What value do you think it offers?
The staging area allows me to decide which files I want to commit, which suits
    the purpose of making one commit per logical change

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
    change?
I can use it to see exactly how diffent the files in the working area is from
    the files in the staging area and how different the files in staging area
	is from the files in the repository.
